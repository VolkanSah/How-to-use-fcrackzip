```sh
sudo apt install fcrackzip
```

## Dependencies
- fcrackzip: A Free/Fast Zip Password Cracker

## Usage
To display help and usage information, run the following command:
```sh
fcrackzip -h
```

## Advanced Examples

### 1. Using Custom Character Sets
Specify a custom character set to limit the brute force attack to specific characters:
```sh
fcrackzip -b -c 1234567890 -l 1-4 protected.zip
```
This command limits the attack to numeric characters and checks passwords of length 1 to 4.

### 2. Parallel Processing
Speed up the cracking process by splitting the task across multiple machines or processes. For example, you can divide the character set and length range:
```sh
fcrackzip -b -c abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz -l 1-3 part1.zip &
fcrackzip -b -c ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ -l 1-3 part2.zip &
```
This runs two processes in parallel, each working on different sets of characters.

### 3. Using Multiple Dictionaries
If you have multiple dictionaries, you can concatenate them and use the combined file:
```sh
cat dict1.txt dict2.txt > combined_dict.txt
fcrackzip -D -p combined_dict.txt protected.zip
```

### 4. Filtering Results with Unzip
Improve accuracy by using unzip to filter out incorrect passwords:
```sh
fcrackzip -u -D -p dictionary.txt protected.zip
```
This ensures only valid passwords are considered.

### 5. Benchmarking
Run a benchmark to see how fast your system can crack passwords:
```sh
fcrackzip -B
```
This can help you estimate how long a full crack might take.

### 6. Specifying Password Length
Limit the password length range to speed up the attack:
```sh
fcrackzip -b -c aA1 -l 4-8 protected.zip
```
This command will only check passwords with lengths between 4 and 8 characters.

### 7. Using Initialization Passwords
If you have a starting point or known part of the password, you can use it to start the attack:
```sh
fcrackzip -b -p knownpart protected.zip
```

### 8. Verbose Mode
Enable verbose mode for more detailed output:
```sh
fcrackzip -v -b -c aA1 -l 1-8 protected.zip
```

### 9. Validating the Algorithm
Sanity-check the algorithm to ensure it's working correctly:
```sh
fcrackzip -V
```

## fcrackzipinfo
To display information about a zip file, use:
```sh
fcrackzipinfo --help
```

### Example Command
To parse and display information about `protected.zip`, use:
```sh
fcrackzipinfo protected.zip
```
